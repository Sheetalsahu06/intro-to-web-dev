        "\n",
        "Answer :- Client-server architecture is a computing model that divides tasks between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients). Here are the main components and their functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Client**  \n",
        "   - A client is a device (computer, smartphone, etc.) or application that requests services or resources from a server.  \n",
        "   - Functions:  \n",
        "     - Sends requests to the server (e.g., web pages, database queries).  \n",
        "     - Processes and presents received data to the user.  \n",
        "     - Can be a thin client (relies on the server for processing) or a thick client (handles some processing locally).  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Server**  \n",
        "   - A server is a powerful computer or software that provides services to clients over a network.  \n",
        "   - Functions:  \n",
        "     - Processes client requests and sends responses.  \n",
        "     - Manages resources such as databases, files, and applications.  \n",
        "     - Ensures security, authentication, and data integrity.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Network**  \n",
        "   - The communication medium that connects clients and servers, enabling data transfer.  \n",
        "   - Functions:  \n",
        "     - Facilitates communication using protocols like HTTP, TCP/IP, and WebSockets.  \n",
        "     - Ensures reliable data transmission between clients and servers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Database (Optional but Common)**  \n",
        "   - A structured system for storing and managing data accessed by the server.  \n",
        "   - Functions:  \n",
        "     - Stores and retrieves data efficiently.  \n",
        "     - Ensures data consistency and security.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Middleware (Optional)**  \n",
        "   - Software that acts as a bridge between clients and servers, managing communication.  \n",
        "   - Functions:  \n",
        "     - Handles authentication, logging, and load balancing.  \n",
        "     - Translates data formats between client and server.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Client-Server Interaction:  \n",
        "1. A user (client) requests a webpage by entering a URL in a browser.  \n",
        "2. The browser sends an HTTP request to a web server.  \n",
        "3. The server processes the request, retrieves the web page from a database or file system, and sends it back.  \n",
        "4. The client (browser) renders and displays the page.  \n",
